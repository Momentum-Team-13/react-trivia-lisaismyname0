useEffect() hooks are meant to run after every render
- a render is when a component runs and returns its JSX
- we describe what is going to happen in our component wheen it happens

in devs for hire example:

useEffect(()=>{
//ajax request to get dev data
axios
.get('API URL')
.then((res)==> console.log(res))
})

Why Axios?
- fetch is great but has limitations that are somewhat annoying... for example you have to have two .thens 
- in axios we don't have to do that second step
- also has a better way of handling 404's
